We know that fifty-one billion tons of greenhouse gases are being pumped into the atmosphere every year and
that the world needs to eliminate as much unnecessary waste as possible if we are to have any chance of getting to zero.
We also know that the environmental cost of the Bitcoin network is now equivalent to that of a moderate sized country.
We need to understand why the Bitcoin network is so wasteful.
We need to do this with urgency as Bitcoin has already reached considerable market adoption and critical mass.

Lex Fridman [1] has recently conducted a valuable series of podcast interviews on YouTube with the leaders of the cryptocurrency industry.
From listening to these discussions it is clear to me that the unnecessary waste is due to Bitcoin using an algorithm called Proof of Work.
This is causing substantial energy cost with no apparent gain and this flaw is already being addressed
with an alternative approach called Proof of Stake in the second and third generation cryptocurrency platforms.

Before explaining what these two approaches are let us look at the core features of cryptocurrencies.

Firstly the main goal is to replace traditional currencies like the dollar or euro with a digital currency.
Secondly they use a new data storage concept, this now famous blockchain, for ensuring that currency transactions are secure and can never be altered.
Each new block in the chain is cryptographically linked to all previous blocks in the chain, meaning no block can be altered without invalidating the whole chain.
And thirdly the goal of these currencies is to remove the need for intermediaries.
This is achieved by large scale distribution of the blockchain data store with every participant using the currency having their own copy.

This large scale distribution or decentralization concept is the core driving force behind cryptocurrencies and the platforms that are emerging in this space.
Decentralization is challenging and more expensive to implement than centralization.
Without a central authority, when new currency transactions occur between participants how can they trust each other and successfully keep their own data copies in sync?

In the distributed computing academic literature this is a known problem for which there are several documented solutions.
It is referred to as the _Byzantine Generals Problem_ the name coming from the allegory which Lamport, Shostak and Pease proposed in their paper in 1982 [2].

The idea is that there is a number of generals who need to decide whether to attack or retreat from a city and they must come to a common agreement.
They can communicate their decision with each other using messengers.
But these messengers could be unreliable and fail to deliver the messages or even deliver false messages.
In cryptocurrency terms the computer nodes would represent the generals and the communication system links would represent the messengers.

To resolve this problem the generals come up with a way to show a sign of good faith.
They do this by showing that they are willing to sacrifice some resource of value if they are caught cheating.
This allows them to come to an agreement even if nearly half of the generals are trying to cheat.

In the case of Proof of Work that resource is a work resource and in the case of Proof of Stake it is an economic resource.

In Bitcoin the Proof of Work task is a cryptographic puzzle that is given to special _miner_ nodes that can take several minutes to solve.
In terms of the Byzantine Generals allegory it would be equivalent to each general asking his infantry to perform some time consuming task,
a useles task like the ones given to Sysyphus, but one that can then be checked by the other generals and will prove his good intentions.

Second and third generation cryptocurrency platforms are moving to the more efficient Proof of Stake approach.
This is where participants put a deposit of some crypto coins down and are prepared to lose them if they are found to be cheating.
In the allegory this would be like the generals staking some of their own physical gold coins as a sign of good will.

It is very obvious that Proof of Stake is a far superior approach because it doesn't incur the high energy cost of Proof of Work.
And Proof of Work is wasting energy because the task is doing nothing useful.

So why then was Proof of Work was the approach proposed in the famous Bitcoin white paper [3] and subsequently adopted?

To understand this we need to go back to the literature to where the idea for Proof of Work originated.
The original idea comes from a paper which suggested it as a solution for combating junk mail [4].
In it Dwork and Naor clearly state why they chose a computational pricing model rather than charging a fee.
They didn't want to deter any one from using the system. Their view was if you charged for email people wouldn't use email.

Remember Bitcoin was the very first cryptocurrency. These had never been seen before.
In the early days the developers would have wanted to attract people to use this new technology.
I think it makes sense that they would have considered computing resources as a better incentive than charging fees.
But I don't think they would ever have anticipated the enormous energy waste that the unrivalled growth of today's Bitcoin network has achieved.

In software engineering, mistakes are nearly always made in the first implementations.
The second and third generation cryptocurrency platforms have corrected many of these mistakes.

Unfortunately, there is much hype around Bitcoin, many have invested before understanding these technical flaws and there is a lot of speculation in the market.
But it is technically possible for any cryptocurrency to migrate from a Proof of Work to a Proof of State model which does not exact such a high toll on our climate.   
And the newer alternatives offering the same services are moving away from Proof of Work.

What we do know is that Proof of Work is causing unnecessary pollution to our environment. We wouldn't allow this in any other industry. So WHY should we tolerate it in the IT industry?

Eliminating this unecessary environmental cost would be a great first step forward in our struggle with climate change.
I think it is crucial that the US and EU regulatory bodies, and all other regulatory bodies around the world act quickly now and ban Proof of Work wherever it is used in crypto currency platforms.
