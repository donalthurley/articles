## Bitcoin Article Proposal

The premise of my proposed article is that the Bitcoin network is unnecessarily causing substantial environmental damage, which is estimated to be the energy usage of a moderate sized country.

Firstly I would explain in the article why it is causing so much environmental damage and then how that could be greatly reduced.

There are three main features of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Firstly they aim to compete with fiat currencies by offering a digital cross border alternative.
Secondly they introduce a relatively new and innovative data storage technology called blockchain which makes currency transactions very secure and protects from data corruption using cryptagraphic techniques.
Thirdly they aim to cut out the middlemen, like bank clearing houses which use centralized databases,
and they achieve this by decentralization which involves distributing the blockchain data storage to every user of the Bitcoin network.

Decentralization is the main driving force behind cryptocurrencies and it is obviously more expensive and complicated.
You need to keep distributed copies of data in sync rather than a small number of copies as are needed in centralized systems.

The environmental damage is being caused by an algorithm called Proof of Work which is being used to solve this distribution problem.
Also this same algorithm is being used as the mechanism for minting coins.
The idea is that all blockchain users prove their good faith by solving a cryptographic puzzle that essentially has no productive value.
The first to solve it gets rewarded a newly minted Bitcoin.
And the Proof of Work acts as evidence that the user is valid, that the new transaction data can be trusted and that all users can update their copies.

However the energy waste in Proof of Work is a known problem and it is being addressed in the second and third generation cryptocurrency platforms with a better algorithm called Proof of Stake which has considerably less environmental cost.
Instead of using computing power as proof of good faith the users stake an amount of coins that they are prepared to lose if it is found that they can't be trusted.
This achieves the same effect by switching from computing resources to an economic resource.

Unfortunately because of the critical mass and network effect that the Bitcoin network has already achieved in the market and because it is technically non trivial to change this core algorithm
it is highly unlikely that the Bitcoin developers and Big IT and finance companies who have invested in Bitcoin would back this change without regulation.

The second generation cryptocurrency Ethereum is currently switching to Proof of Stake which is proof that it is technically possible to make this move.
This article would propose that the EU and US regulators ban the Proof of Work approach and encourage the Bitcoin network to move to the better Proof of Stake algorithm.
