## Bitcoin Article Proposal

The premise of my proposed article is that the Bitcoin network is unnecessarily causing substantial environmental damage, which is estimated to be the energy usage of a moderate sized country.
This is important to address now because the Bitcoin price has been rapidly rising in the last few weeks and 
the climate impact is colossal and this is not getting the deserved attention from the general media.
Nor are the flaws in the design of Bitcoin that are causing the large environmental impact generally appreciated. 

I am a software consultant, currently working on contract with IBM security services, own no cryptocurrencies, nor have any conflict of interest.
I have a tehcnical appreciation of the technology and have great concern for the damage being caused.
I'm open to working with anyone who could help get this message out. If someone can write it better I'm happy with that. 

Decentralization is the main driving force behind cryptocurrencies and it is obviously more expensive and complicated to achieve this.
You need to keep distributed copies of data in sync rather than a small number of copies as are needed in centralized systems.

The environmental damage is being caused by an algorithm called Proof of Work which is being used to solve this distribution problem.
Also this same algorithm is being used as the mechanism for minting coins.
The idea is that all blockchain users prove their good faith by solving a cryptographic puzzle that essentially has no productive value.
The first to solve it gets rewarded a newly minted Bitcoin.
And the Proof of Work acts as evidence that the user is valid, that the new transaction data can be trusted and that all users can update their copies.

However the energy waste in Proof of Work is a known problem and it is being addressed in the second and third generation cryptocurrency platforms with a better algorithm called Proof of Stake which has considerably less environmental cost.
Instead of using computing power as proof of good faith the users stake an amount of coins that they are prepared to lose if it is found that they can't be trusted.
This achieves the same effect by switching from computing resources to an economic resource.

Unfortunately because of the critical mass and network effect that the Bitcoin network has already achieved in the market and because it is technically non trivial to change this core algorithm
it is highly unlikely that the Bitcoin developers and Big IT and finance companies who have invested in Bitcoin would back this change without regulation.
The argument often is made that switching Bitcoin mining to Green sources would solve the problem but this is not a good argument.
Green resources should be diverted to other more worthy causes like Data Centers and the expensive GPU and ASIC hardware involved in mining should also be diverted to more worthy uses. 

This article would propose that the EU and US regulators ban the Proof of Work approach and encourage the Bitcoin network to move to the better Proof of Stake algorithm.
