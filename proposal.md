## Bitcoin Article Proposal

The premise of my proposed article is that the Bitcoin network is unnecessarily causing substantial environmental damage, which is estimated to be the energy usage of a moderate sized country.
This is important to address now because the Bitcoin price has been rapidly rising in the last few weeks. 
The climate impact is colossal and this is not getting the deserved attention from the general media.
Nor are the flaws in the design of Bitcoin that are causing the large environmental impact generally understood. 

I am a software consultant, 35 years in IT, contracted with IBM security services, don't own nor work with cryptocurrencies.
Have a technical appreciation of the technology and a great concern for the damage being caused. 

### Article Outline

Decentralization is the main driving force behind cryptocurrencies.
You need to keep distributed copies of data in sync rather than a small number of copies as are done in centralized systems.

The environmental damage in Bitcoin is being caused by an algorithm called Proof of Work which is used to solve the distribution problem.
Blockchain users prove their good faith by solving a compute intensive cryptographic puzzle that essentially has no productive value.
Proof of Work acts as evidence that the user is valid, that new transaction data can be trusted and all users can update their copies.
This same algorithm is also used as the mechanism for minting coins, i.e., the winner of the puzzle gets a coin. 

The energy waste in Proof of Work is a known problem and it is being addressed in the second and third generation cryptocurrency platforms.
These use an algorithm called Proof of Stake which has considerably less environmental cost.
The idea is that the users stake an amount of coins that they are prepared to lose if it is found that they can't be trusted.
This solves the distribution consensus problem by switching from computing resources to an economic resource.

Unfortunately because of the critical mass Bitcoin has achieved and the difficulties in changing the algorithm
it is unlikely that Bitcoin investors would willingly move to Proof of Stake without regulation.

The argument that switching Bitcoin mining to Green resources solves the environmental problem is incorrect.
Green resources and the expensive GPU/ASIC hardware involved in mining should be diverted to more worthy causes.

This article would propose that EU,UK and US should regulate to ban the use of Proof of Work in cryptocurrencies.
